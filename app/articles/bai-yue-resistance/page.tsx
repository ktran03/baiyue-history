        The Bai Yue (百越, "Hundred Yue") were not passive victims of history. For centuries, they resisted Chinese colonization, staging uprisings, fighting wars, and even establishing their own independent states. Modern Chinese narratives often frame these conflicts as "local revolts," but they were actually a long struggle for sovereignty—similar to Vietnam’s later wars against the French and Americans.
