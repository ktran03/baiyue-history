        Tea is often considered one of China’s greatest cultural contributions. However, modern research suggests that tea was first cultivated and consumed by the <strong>Bai Yue people</strong>—the indigenous inhabitants of Southern China and Northern Vietnam—long before it was adopted by the Han Chinese.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The First Tea Plants Were Found in Bai Yue Lands</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Many assume tea originated in Central China, but archaeological and botanical studies show that the first wild tea trees (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) were native to Southern China, Yunnan, and Northern Vietnam—territories historically inhabited by the Bai Yue.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Archaeological and Genetic Evidence</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>The oldest wild tea trees have been found in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Northern Vietnam.</li>
        <li>A 2016 study on tea genetics found that the genetic diversity of tea is highest in these regions, indicating their origin.</li>
        <li>Excavations in Bai Yue regions have uncovered tea remains dating back over 4,000 years, predating written Chinese records of tea.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The Bai Yue’s Role in Early Tea Culture</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Unlike the formalized tea ceremonies that later developed in China, the Bai Yue used tea primarily for medicinal and spiritual purposes.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">How Did the Bai Yue Use Tea?</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Traditional Herbal Medicine:</strong> Tea was brewed as a healing drink.</li>
        <li><strong>Shamanistic Rituals:</strong> Indigenous groups related to the Bai Yue, such as the Zhuang and Dai, used tea in ceremonies and spirit offerings.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermented & Chewed Tea:</strong> Early Bai Yue groups often fermented tea leaves or chewed them directly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">How the Han Chinese Adopted Tea from the Bai Yue</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>During the Qin and Han dynasties (221 BCE – 220 CE), Han settlers encountered Bai Yue tea cultivation.</li>
        <li>By the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), tea became a national drink in China, but this was centuries after the Bai Yue had already been consuming it.</li>
        <li>The first Chinese book on tea, <i>Lu Yu’s Classic of Tea</i> (8th century CE), systematized tea culture but drew heavily from Bai Yue knowledge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Bai Yue Influence on Modern Tea Traditions</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Vietnam:</strong> Traditional green tea (<i>Trà Xanh</i>) and fermented tea (<i>Trà Shan Tuyết</i>) remain popular.</li>
        <li><strong>Thailand & Laos:</strong> Herbal tea traditions connect back to the Tai-Kadai descendants of the Bai Yue.</li>
        <li><strong>Yunnan (Dai & Bulang People):</strong> Pu-erh tea-making methods align more with early Bai Yue tea practices than with classical Chinese styles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Reclaiming Bai Yue’s Contribution to Tea</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Tea cultivation did not begin in Han China—it originated in Bai Yue lands.</li>
        <li>Vietnamese, Zhuang, Dai, and other Bai Yue-descended peoples still preserve unique tea traditions.</li>
        <li>Recognizing Bai Yue contributions is essential for a more accurate history of East Asia.</li>
